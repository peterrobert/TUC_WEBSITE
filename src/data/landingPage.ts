        "description": "Talented people have ideas. Organizations need those ideas. But the gap between having an idea and seeing it implemented is vast. Most suggestions vanish into email threads, Slack channels, or meeting notes. Good thinking gets lost not because it lacks merit, but because there's no reliable system to capture, evaluate, and act on it."

        "title": "The Fragmentation Problem",

There's no shared infrastructure for collaboration that respects autonomy while enabling coordination. We're all reinventing wheels because we can't see what others have already built."

        "title": "The Trust Problem",

Without transparent systems that protect contributors and track attribution, collaboration remains risky and extractive."
