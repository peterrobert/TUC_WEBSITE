            Transparency isn't a marketing tactic—it's a structural requirement
            for building trust. When people can see how decisions are made,
            they're more likely to believe the system operates fairly. When
            reasoning is documented, mistakes can be identified and corrected.
            When processes are visible, corruption becomes harder.

            Most systems fail not because of technical problems, but because
            trust erodes. Contributors stop participating when they realize
            they're being exploited. Users leave when they discover hidden
            agendas. Communities collapse when leadership becomes opaque.
